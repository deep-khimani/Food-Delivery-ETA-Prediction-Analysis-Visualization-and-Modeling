## 💡 Key Features

- **EDA:** Inspection of data structure, missing values, categorical/numerical feature analysis.
- **Advanced Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, distribution plots, categorical comparisons, geospatial insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Route distance calculation from coordinates, temporal features, categorical encoding.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Regression modeling (e.g., Random Forest), error reporting (RMSE, MAE, R²).
- **Modularity:** Each analysis step is contained in a dedicated notebook for workflow clarity.
